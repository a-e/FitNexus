This is where you may optionally define reusable scenarios that are shared by your Rsel script tables. Here are a couple of examples:

| scenario | Login with username _ and password _ | username, password |
| Visit | /login |
| Fill in | Username | with | @username |
| Fill in | Password | with | @password |
| Press | Log in |
| See | Welcome, @username |

| scenario | Logout |
| Click | Log out | link |
| See | You are logged out |
