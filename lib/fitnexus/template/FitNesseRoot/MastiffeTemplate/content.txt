This subwiki is a template for writing manual tests using Mastiffe. Some basic configuration settings are provided, along with example tests. See the [[Mastiffe documentation][http://github.com/a-e/Mastiffe]] for more information.

These variables must be defined in order for Mastiffe to work:
!define TEST_SYSTEM {slim}
!define TEST_RUNNER {rubyslim}
!define COMMAND_PATTERN {rubyslim}

If you're using [[Bundler][http://gembundler.com]], you may need to change ''rubyslim'' to ''bundle exec rubyslim'' in the lines above.

!contents -R2 -g -p -f -h
