This subwiki has some examples of how to write automated Cucumber tests using Cukable. See the [[Cukable documentation][http://rdoc.info/github/wapcaplet/cukable/frames]] for more comprehensive information.

If you already have a suite of Cucumber tests, and you'd like to convert them for use by Cukable, [[use the cuke2fit script][http://rdoc.info/github/wapcaplet/cukable/master/file/docs/converting.md]]. You'll also need to [[configure Cucumber with the Slim JSON output formatter][http://rdoc.info/github/wapcaplet/cukable/master/file/docs/install.md]].

The main subwiki for your Cukable tests must include these lines:
!define TEST_SYSTEM {slim}
!define TEST_RUNNER {rubyslim}
!define COMMAND_PATTERN {rubyslim}

If you're using [[Bundler][http://gembundler.com]], you may need to change ''rubyslim'' to ''bundle exec rubyslim'' in the lines above.
